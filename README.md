## Planning Story





### User Stories

- As a user, I would like to be able to sign up for this application
  - As a user, I would like my email address to perists if I mess up my password so that I do not need to re-type it.
- As a user I would like to be able to sign in to the application
- As a user I would like to be able to sign out of the application
- As a user I would like to be able to change my password
- As a user I would like to be able to Create a new shopping list
- As a user I would like to be able to add items to my shopping list with a single 'add' button that does not refresh the app
- As a user I would like to be able to delete an item by clicking a button attached to each item
- As a user I would like to be able to be able to edit my items in my list
 - As a user, it would be nice if the text itself was editable and did not require a form
 - As a user, I would like if I could specify a quantity for the items in my list


##STRETCH GOALS
- As a user, I would like to be able to have multiple lists for different reasons
- As a user, I would like these lists to be accessible from the nav pane in either a tabbed view or a dropdown list
- As a user, I would like if I could share my list with another user so that either user would then have full access to the list.
- As a user, it would be nice if I could keep track of the estimated cost of items in an item-based list
- As a user, I would like to be able to mark an item as completed in a task-based list
- As a user, ideally I would like my list to update when another user cruds the list without me having to worry about it on my end. 'sync'
